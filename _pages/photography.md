# Photography

Welcome to my photography showcase! Here you'll find a collection of my favorite shots, ranging from landscapes to automobiles. I currently live in the beautiful Blue Ridge mountains. Capturing nature's curves and horsepower's roar — one frame at a time.

## About My Photography

I enjoy capturing moments that tell stories, whether it's the golden hour light hitting a cityscape or the quiet beauty of nature. Photography has become a way for me to document my travels, experiences, and the world around me. I really started collecting these images around the start of the pandemic. I found myself with a bit of free time from the shutdown and the national parks hadn't quite become so crowded. 

## Featured Collections

### US National Parks
*Breathtaking views from my travels*

*Angels Landing is one of Zion National Park's most iconic and thrilling hikes, renowned for its steep, narrow ridge and breathtaking views of Zion Canyon. The 5.4-mile round-trip trail includes a series of switchbacks known as Walter’s Wiggles and culminates in a dramatic, exposed rock spine with chains to assist hikers.*

![MoquiCaverns](/assets/images/photography/MoquiCaverns.jpeg)
*The Moqui Caverns, also known as the Kanab Sand Caves, aren’t natural formations but human‑made tunnels carved into Navajo sandstone in the 1970s. They were originally excavated to mine the soft sand for glass production. Over time, multiple connected chambers with arched ceilings and sandy floors emerged, now enjoyed by hikers and families*

![Peekaboo Slot Canyons](/assets/images/photography/PeekabooSlotCanyon.jpeg)
*Peekaboo Slot Canyons are a series of stunning, narrow sandstone canyons located in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. Known for their winding passages, sculpted red rock walls, and dramatic lighting, these canyons offer a unique and adventurous hiking experience.*

![The Narrows ](/assets/images/photography/Thenarrows.jpg)
*The Narrows is one of the most iconic and breathtaking hikes in Zion National Park, Utah. Carved by the Virgin River over millions of years, this deep slot canyon features towering sandstone walls that rise up to 1,000 feet high while narrowing to just 20–30 feet across in places. Hikers wade and sometimes swim through the river itself, making the journey as much about water navigation as it is about scenic exploration.*
